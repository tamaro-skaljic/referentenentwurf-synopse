## Methodologies

### Test Driven Development (TDD)

#### Definitions

| Term                      | Meaning                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Red**                   | Test is collected, runs, and fails on an assertion                          |
| **Green**                 | Test passes after implementation changes                                    |
| **Refactor**              | Code cleanup while tests remain green                                       |
| **Signature change**      | Adding function parameters, class/dataclass fields, or protocol members     |
| **Implementation change** | Modifying function or method bodies                                         |
| **Observable behavior**   | Outputs, return values, or side effects visible through the public API      |

#### Execution Steps

1. Write a test calling the desired public API.
2. Resolve syntax/import errors by signature changes only. No implementation changes.
3. Run the test. Confirm assertion failure.
4. Write minimal implementation code.
5. Run the test. Confirm it passes.
6. Refactor. Confirm tests remain green.

#### Phase Validation Criteria

##### Red Phase

Run `pytest -q`. All conditions must be true:

| Condition         | Validation                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collects          | No syntax/import errors during test collection                 |
| Runs              | Test executes without unexpected exceptions before assertions  |
| Fails             | Assertion fails (e.g., `assert expected == actual`)           |
| API shape only    | Only signatures, class fields, or protocol members changed    |
| Tests behavior    | Assertion checks outputs, not internal state                   |

If any condition is false, fix the test or signatures before proceeding.

| Symptom               | Diagnosis                              | Action                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Syntax/import error   | Missing API shape or broken imports    | Add parameters, fields, or imports   |
| Exception before assert | Missing setup or invalid state       | Fix test setup                       |
| Test passes           | Behavior already exists or test is bad | Verify test logic                    |
| Implementation edited | Function body modified                 | Revert implementation changes        |

##### Green Phase

Run `pytest -q`. All conditions must be true:

| Condition              | Validation                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Test passes            | Assertion succeeds                  |
| Implementation minimal | No code beyond what test requires   |
| Test unchanged         | Test file has no modifications      |

Modify implementation to pass the test. Keep the test unchanged.

##### Refactor Phase

Run `pytest -q` after each change. Condition: all tests pass.

#### Example

Goal: Watcher emits one event per file during rapid saves (currently emits multiple).

##### Red

Step 1: Write test calling desired API.

```python
import time


def test_rapid_saves_produce_single_event(tmp_path):
  # Arrange
  config = FileSystemWatcherConfiguration(debounce_milliseconds=100)
  file_system_watcher, receiver = create_file_system_watcher(config)
  watch_path(file_system_watcher, tmp_path)
  target_path = tmp_path / "sample.txt"

  # Act: trigger multiple filesystem writes
  for index in range(10):
    target_path.write_text(f"v{index}", encoding="utf-8")
  time.sleep(0.2)

  # Assert: expect 1 event (will fail when impl added)
  events = collect_all(receiver)
  assert len(events) == 1
```

Step 2: Resolve syntax/import errors (signature changes only).

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class FileSystemWatcherConfiguration:
  debounce_milliseconds: int


def create_file_system_watcher(
  config: FileSystemWatcherConfiguration,
) -> tuple[FileSystemWatcher, EventReceiver]:
  raise NotImplementedError  # unchanged behavior
```

Step 3: Run test.

Run: `pytest -q -k rapid_saves` → raises `NotImplementedError` before assertion → Fix: replace with minimal non-raising stub → Run again → fails with `assert len(events) == 1` mismatch (`10 != 1`) → Red confirmed.

##### Green

Implement deduplication using `config.debounce_milliseconds` in `create_file_system_watcher`. Run: `pytest -q -k rapid_saves` → passes → Green confirmed.

##### Refactor

Clean up. Run: `pytest -q` → all pass → Refactor complete.

### Self-Documenting Code

Code must be self-documenting through clear naming:

- **No abbreviations**: Use `InputOutput` not `Io`, `FileSystemWatcher` not `Watcher`, `DirectoryWalker` not `Walk`.
- **Descriptive identifiers**: Names should convey meaning without requiring comments.
- **No redundant comments**: Never document "how" - the code shows that. Only document "what" and "why" when not obvious from the code itself.
- **Remove comments that repeat the code**: A comment like `/// IO error.` above `Io(io::Error)` adds no value.

#### Dependency & Interface Management

- [ ] Decide early which responsibilities belong to the framework versus custom modules.
- [ ] Route orchestration through containers, factories, or callbacks instead of ad-hoc callers.

- [ ] Never strengthen preconditions when overriding base behavior.
- [ ] Never weaken postconditions or invariants in derived classes.
- [ ] Subtypes only throw exceptions declared by the base.
- [ ] Remove hierarchies that force instanceof checks in clients.

#### Variation Isolation & Extensibility

- [ ] Minimize changes to existing code to preserve stability.
- [ ] Favor extension points over direct modification.
- [ ] Hide non-variant details and expose only adjustable seams.
- [ ] Minimize edits whenever change happens.

### Conflicts between Programming Principles

- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) vs Boy Scout Rule** — Cleaning adjacent code “just because” risks shipping scope beyond the current story YAGNI enforces, while only delivering the current story can stop you from making opportunistic cleanups the Boy Scout Rule encourages.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Boy Scout Rule" over the "You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)" principle.
- **Separation of Concerns vs Maximize Cohesion** — Splitting behavior strictly by technical concern can scatter workflows that cohesion would otherwise keep together, while grouping everything by cohesive domain can blur the technical boundaries the Separation of Concerns checklist enforces.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Maximize Cohesion" principle without violating the "Separation of Concerns" principle by splitting in domain modules which wire together technical modules.
- **Code For The Maintainer vs Optimize for Deletion** — Designing code to be disposable may trade away the documentation and guardrails maintainers need, while preserving extensive context and commentary makes code heavier and harder to throw away.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Optimize for Deletion" principle without violating the "Code For The Maintainer" principle by writing self-documenting code.
- **Code For The Maintainer vs Hide Implementation Details** — Strict encapsulation can obscure the intent and rationale that future maintainers are supposed to see, yet surfacing intent for future readers can pressure you to expose structure that this principle would otherwise hide.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Hide Implementation Details" principle without violating the "Code For The Maintainer" principle by maintaining clear conventions for data flow from entry points to utilities.
- **Avoid Premature Optimization vs Optimize for Deletion** — Engineering for easy removal ahead of evidence is still speculative optimization before you know deletion is necessary, while the directive to defer speculative work pushes back on adding deletion seams before they are justified.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Optimize for Deletion" principle because the "Avoid Premature Optimization" principle is about performance (CPU cycles, memory usage, etc.), which is more measurable than code quality.
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) vs Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** — Splitting interfaces per client can reintroduce similar method signatures, undermining a single authoritative implementation, but centralizing behavior for reuse can bloat interfaces with methods some clients do not need.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Interface Segregation Principle" principle without violating the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle by carefully managing shared abstractions used by the different client interfaces.
- **Connascence vs Orthogonality** — Enforcing total independence between modules can make it harder to surface and manage the necessary relationships connascence tracks, whereas allowing related elements to evolve together acknowledges coupling that orthogonality tries to eliminate.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Connascence" principle without violating the "Orthogonality" principle by splitting in domain modules which wire together technical modules.
- **Minimize Coupling vs Command Query Separation (CQS)** — Splitting reads and writes across distinct interfaces increases the number of collaborators you have to coordinate, yet reducing the number of dependencies can discourage the extra command/query partitions this principle demands.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Command Query Separation" principle over the "Minimize Coupling" principle.
- **Law of Demeter vs Inversion of Control** — Depending on global containers or callbacks can force knowledge of collaborators beyond the immediate neighbor, and IoC plumbing may require reaching into containers or nested delegates, effectively talking to strangers' collaborators.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Law of Demeter" principle over the "Inversion of Control" principle.
- **Composition Over Inheritance vs Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** — Favoring composition can mean rejecting subtype hierarchies even when safe substitution could simplify clients, while insisting on composition can prevent you from leveraging polymorphic substitution even when it preserves contracts.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Composition Over Inheritance" principle over the "Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)" principle.
- **Maximize Cohesion vs Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** — Keeping all closely-related actions together may introduce multiple reasons for the same module to change, and keeping every related behavior together can mix multiple reasons for change inside a single module.
  - **Important Action**: Favor the "Maximize Cohesion" principle without violating the "Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)" principle by splitting in domain modules which wire together technical modules.
- **Curly's Law vs Encapsulate What Changes** — Focusing on isolating volatility can slice one user-facing outcome across many modules, violating the single-goal guidance, while keeping all logic for one goal together can make it harder to extract the unstable parts into their own modules.
  - **Important Action**: Favor "Curly's Law" without violating the "Encapsulate What Changes" principle by splitting in domain modules which wire together technical modules.

- **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) vs Open/Closed** — Designing extension seams up front can add abstraction layers that move the system away from the simplest implementation, while stripping code down to its bare minimum can remove the extension points the Open/Closed principle expects.
  - **Action**: Favor the "Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)" principle over the "Open/Closed" principle.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) vs Robustness Principle** — Hardening for malformed inputs may require building capabilities no stakeholder has requested yet, but skipping defensive code for future scenarios contradicts the robustness expectation to handle unknown inputs now.
  - **Action**: Favor the "Robustness Principle" over the "You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)" principle.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) vs F.I.R.S.T Principles of Testing** — Authoring comprehensive, pre-emptive tests can feel like upfront work outside the immediate requirement, yet limiting work to what is requested can undercut the up-front comprehensive coverage that F.I.R.S.T expects.
  - **Action**: Favor the "F.I.R.S.T Principles of Testing" over the "You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)" principle.
- **Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work vs Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** — Introducing abstractions and injection layers adds ceremony beyond the quickest working solution, while pursuing the most direct implementation can skip the abstraction seams that dependency inversion requires.
  - **Action**: Favor the "Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)" over the "Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work" principle.
- **Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work vs Inversion of Control** — Delegating orchestration to containers or callbacks introduces indirection that contradicts the most straightforward implementation, yet wiring everything through IoC containers is rarely the most straightforward path for a small change.
  - **Action**: Favor the "Inversion of Control" principle over the "Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work" principle.
- **Separation of Concerns vs Arrange, Act, Assert (3A)** — Keeping setup, action, and verification steps co-located inside one test clashes with attempts to isolate each concern into shared helpers, but forcing those steps into separate fixtures undermines the single-test narrative the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern emphasizes.
  - **Action**: Favor the "Separation of Concerns" principle over the "Arrange, Act, Assert (3A)" principle.
